# Draw your League of Legends Draft

This is an simple application that lets you draw the League of Legends draft.

## Description

I play often with my friends in League of Legends. One day I came up with the idea of creating an app that that draws League of Legends drafts. I used [Data Dragon](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#data-dragon) data to download splash arts.

You can also save a selected draft to a browser local storage.

The application is adjusted to look good on smartphones as well as on desktops.
